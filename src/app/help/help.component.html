  <h2>Welcome to help section</h2>
</div>

<div class="ml-3">
<p>Design section</p>
<p>Specify the width and height of your canvas and then press create new canvas</p>
<p>You will be presented with a new view with all the available functions to you</p>
<p>Let's start with the most important part: designing a pattern!</p>

<p>First you click on the main canvas area to draw rectangles on it, and when you want to,
  just click the Make design button and you will see the result. Very simple.</p>


<p>Pattern maker section</p>
<p>Specify the amount of threads, the width and height of your canvas and then press create new canvas</p>
<p>The view is almost exactly the same as in design section, but if you try to click on the main canvas, you will notice that it doesn't work.</p>
<p>In the pattern maker side you have to click on the sides to automatically draw a picture on the main canvas.</p>

<p>Note, you need to have clicked on all three sides before anything is drawn on the main canvas.</p>

<p>That's it for the basic introduction, next we will go through the menu.</p>

<p>Hide menu, and after clicking hide, show menu, are quite self explanatory. They hide and show the menu.</p>

<p>You might have noticed that small checkbox on the top right side of the menu. (Unless your screen with is very small)</p>
<p>Even though it's not named in anyway, it provides you with the function to pin the menu and take it with you if your canvas is big.</p>

<p>After clicking the checkbox, the menu will be fixed to the side of your screen and will stay there when moving around the page</p>
<p>When unchecked, the menu returns to it's original position</p>

<p>Change size might be badly named, but it just increases the area of each rectangle.</p>

<p>Just specify the desired size and press change size</p>

<p>If you are on the pattern maker side, there will be another button under the size button, update shaft button</p>
<p>This button allows you to change the size of the shaft that you chose in the beginning, without losing your progress</p>
<p>Unless, of course, you make the shaft smaller and you had something on the edges</p>


<p>The show reverse button shows the "reverse side" of the canvas. Basically this just inverts the clicked and unclicked rectangle colors</p>

<p>Next are the color options. Here you can change the color of the canvas to what you desire.</p>
<p>Just click on the warp or weft button and a color picker menu will open. Choose a color here.</p>
<p>If you open the color picker again, you might notice that the color you just picked was saved to the preset colors</p>
<p>After changing the color you can go to click on the top rows of the respective orientations.</p>
<p>Warp color is used when determining and changing the color of the color bar above.</p>
<p>Weft is used when determining and changing the color of the color bar to the left</p>
<p>Both of these buttons also have a fill option after them.</p>
<p>Clicking these buttons, sets the color to the selected color for the whole row, respectively</p>

<p>In the next menu, you can increase or decrease the size of the canvas without losing the progress you've made</p>
<p>Simply click on the arrow you wish and a row is added to that "direction".</p>
<p>If you click the plus button in the center, this menu will be changed to deletion menu</p>
<p>This menu works in the same way as when adding the rows. Just click on the arrow and a row is deleted from that "direction".</p>
<p>Click on the minus button in the center to return to the add rows menu</p>

<p>The "take canvas to" button will take your canvas to the "other side" without losing your progress.</p>
<p>For example, you have been making a design in the design side, but feel like you want to continue in the pattern maker side, simply press the button and your canvas is taken with you</p>
<p>A word of warning, when going from pattern maker to design, your canvases' sides might change. This is due to the fact that design maker makes the most optimized pattern that it can out of the main canvas.</p>
<p>This does not however change the contents of the main canvas, thus you do not need to worry about it, unless you really like what you have made on the sides and want to keep it exactly like that.</p>

<p>Download canvas image does exactly that. If clicked, the canvas you see on your screen is downloaded as a png picture to your computer.</p>

<p>Lastly, if you have logged in, you can save your canvas here. Clicking this button will open a new window where you can specify the name for your canvas</p>
<p>Choose something memorable and click save</p>
<p>If you have made something without logging in, you can still create a new account, confirm the email and log in without losing the progress you have made on your canvas. Logging in does not clear the canvas</p>

<p style="background-color: red">IMPORTANT!</p><p>Due to size constraints, one user is only allowed to save 10 canvases on the server currently.</p>
<p>If you have exceeded this limit, but have already made something on the canvas that you do not want to lose, simply open the website in a new window or tab,
  sign in, if you haven't already, and go to the user menu by clicking your email address</p>
<p>Here you can delete a pattern you have made and then you can return to the original window and save your new creation</p>
